Linear regression is the workhorse of applied statistics. Its robustness and easy interpretation are but two of the many reasons that it is often the first and frequently the last stop on the way to characterizing empirical relationships among observed variables. We will start with covering the functions and tools to run simple linear regression models in R, closely following the BBR readings for this week. The objectives of this lab are as follows

1. Learn how to run and evaluate a simple linear regression model
2. Learn how to calculate and evaluate model fit

To help us accomplish these learning objectives, we will examine the association between neighborhood characteristics and COVID-19 case rates in New York City zip codes. New York City is the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.  We will examine whether there are disparities in the types of neighborhoods that have been hit the hardest in the city.

## **Installing and loading packages**
\

We'll be using a couple of new packages in this lab.  First, you'll need to install them.  The code below checks if you've already installed these packages before.  If you haven't, it will install them.

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!require("broom")) install.packages("broom")
if (!require("gridExtra")) install.packages("gridExtra")
if (!require("classInt")) install.packages("classInt")
```

Load these packages and others we will need for this lab.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gridExtra)
library(broom)
library(spdep)
library(sf)
```

## **Why linear regression**
\

There are three main reasons to run a linear regression:

1. You want to **describe** the relationship between two variables.
2. You want to **infer** the causal effect of one variable on another.
3. You want to **predict** the value of one variable from another.

We will be covering reasons 1 and 2 in the next couple of labs.  We will cover reason 3 later in the quarter when we dive into statistical learning.

Why linear and not something else? It's computationally easy. The estimated relationships are easy to describe. If certain assumptions are correct, it does a good job describing the relationship.  We will cover nonlinear regression techniques later in the quarter.


Our research question in this lab is: What ecological characteristics are associated with zip code COVID-19 case rates in New York City?



<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

## **Bringing in the data**
\

Download the csv file *zctanyctracts.csv* and the shapefile (zipped) *zctanyc.shp* located on Canvas in the Lab and Assignments Week 5 folder.  Read in the New York City zipcode csv file using the `read_csv()` function.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
zctanyc <- read_csv("zctanyccovid.csv")
```

COVID-19 case data were downloaded from the [NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data) (confirmed cases up through April 24, 2020).  Socioeconomic and demographic data were downloaded from the 2014-2018 [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs). A record layout of the data can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geo200cn/data/master/zctanyccovidRL.txt).  We will not use all of these variables. We will do so next lab when we go through multiple linear regression.

Next bring in the New York City zipcode shape file using `st_read()`

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results = "hide"}
zctanyc.sf <- st_read("zctanyc.shp")
```

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Mapping**
\

Your first instinct as a Geographer when given new data is to map. MAP, Map, map (not MAUP, because Geographers don't like that).  We won't be using any spatial analysis tools in this lab, but mapping is fun and gives you a sense of how the values of your variables are distributed across space. 

First, we need to join the zipcode data *zctanyc* to the **sf** object *zctanyc.sf* using `left_join()`

```{r}
zctanyc.sf <- left_join(zctanyc.sf, zctanyc, by = "GEOID")
```

We can now map our main variable of interest, COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents (*covidrate*). I use `ggplot()`, but you can load in **tmap** if like `tm_shape()` more.

```{r}
ggplot(zctanyc.sf) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = covidrate)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low= "white", high = "red",  name ="") + 
  labs(title = "COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents by NYC zip codes") +  
  theme( axis.text =  element_blank(),
    axis.ticks =  element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank())
```

Let's visually compare this map to our independent variable percent black (*pblk*).  

```{r}
ggplot(zctanyc.sf) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = pblk)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low= "white", high = "red",  name ="") + 
  labs(title = "Percent black") +  
  theme( axis.text =  element_blank(),
    axis.ticks =  element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank())
```


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Correlation**
\

We are interested in understanding the ecological characteristics associated with zipcode level COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents (*covidrate*). Let's examine its association with neighborhood percent black *pblk*.  One of the first steps in conducting a data analysis is to plot the two variables to detect whether a relationship exists.  Because COVID-19 rates and percent black are numeric variables, we can construct a scatter plot to examine the relationship. First, let's scale *pblk* to be from 0 to 100 (as opposed to 0 to 1).

```{r}
zctanyc <- mutate(zctanyc, pblk = pblk*100)
```

Let's use our reliable friend `ggplot()` again.

```{r}
ggplot(zctanyc) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = pblk, y = covidrate)) +
    xlab("Percent black") +
    ylab("COVID-19 cases per 1,000")
```

The relationship is not super clear. The next step is to calculate the correlation between variables to get a numerical summary of the relationship.  A picture and a numerical summary is a good combination.

Use the function `cor.test()` to calculate the Pearson correlation between COVID-19 case rates and median household income.

```{r}
cor.test(zctanyc$covidrate, zctanyc$pblk) 
```

The correlation ranges from -1 to 0 to 1, with -1 indicating perfect negative correlation and 1 indicating perfect positive correlation. The correlation is 0.34 with a p-value near 0.


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Simple linear regression**
\

In correlation analysis, the two variables whose association is being measured are treated interchangeably.  In contrast, a regression analysis designates a response or dependent variable *Y* and an independent or explanatory variable *X*.  The idea is that there is a direction in the relationship.  *X* leads to, predicts or potentially *causes* *Y*.

We will designate COVID-19 rates as the dependent variable.  We will examine its relationship with percent black, which is the independent variable.  The most common regression model is a linear regression model.  The most common approach to estimating a regression model is ordinary least squares (OLS). A linear regression model containing only one independent variable is known as a simple linear regression.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Quantitative independent variable**
\

We use the function `lm()` to run a regression of COVID-19 case rates on percent black.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
lm1 <- lm(covidrate ~ pblk, data = zctanyc)
```

The first argument in `lm()` is the outcome. This is followed by the `~` operator and then the independent variable. 

“Printing” the object gives a very short summary

```{r}
lm1
```

`names()` function reveals what’s contained in the *lm1* object.

```{r}
names(lm1)
```

We find out we can extract neat things like the residuals

```{r results = "hide"}
lm1$residuals
```

Also the fitted values

```{r results = "hide"}
lm1$fitted.values
```

<p class="comment", style="font-style:normal">**Question 1**: Your educated but non mathy mother-in-law asks you this Christmas to explain to her what residuals and fitted values are. What do you say? (Don't be snarky or rude. She is family, you know) </p>

<br>


The `summary()` function provides more detailed results

```{r}
summary(lm1)
```

If you don't like results in scientific notation, type in

```{r}
options(scipen=999)
```

You can also create a *tidy* table of regression results using the `tidy()` function, which is a part of the **broom** package

```{r}
tidy(lm1)
```


<br>

<p class="comment", style="font-style:normal">**Question 2**:  What is the interpretation of the intercept?  What is the interpretation of the slope coefficient?  </p>

<br>

<p class="comment", style="font-style:normal">**Question 3**: What is the predicted value of COVID-19 rates at 10 percent black?  50 percent? </p>

<br>

<p class="comment", style="font-style:normal">**Question 4**: Plot the independent and dependent variables. Also plot the least squares regression line. You want something that looks like BBR Figure 4-12 on page 179 </p>

<br>


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Qualitative independent variable**
\

The variables *pblk* is quantitative or numeric.  Let's examine a qualitative independent variable.  First, let's examine the variable *poor*, which categorizes the zipcode as a poor (poverty rate greater than 30%) and nonpoor (poverty rate less than or equal to 30%) neighborhood.  It's qualitative because the values are "Poor" and "Nonpoor".  In regression lingo, this is also known as a dummy variable where "Yes" is coded as 1 and "No" is coded as 0.

```{r}
lm2 <- lm(covidrate ~  poor, data = zctanyc)
summary(lm2)
```

<br>

<p class="comment", style="font-style:normal">**Question 5**: What is the interpretation of the  coefficient for the *poorPoor* variable? </p>

<br>

Next, let's examine a multi-categorical variable.  Here, instead of two categories, we have multiple.  Let's examine the variable *borough*, which identifies the New York City Borough (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island) the zipcode is located. It's qualitative because the values are the names of the 5 boroughs. 


```{r}
lm3 <- lm(covidrate ~  borough, data = zctanyc)
summary(lm3)
```

<br>

<p class="comment", style="font-style:normal">**Question 6**: What is the interpretation of the  coefficients *boroughBrooklyn*, *boroughManhattan*, *boroughQueens* and *boroughStaten Island*? </p>

<br>

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Goodness of fit**
\

BBR on page 181 asks: how well does the line fit the original data. BBR introduces several measures. The most popular measure is the coefficient of determination, also known as $R^2$. The value is given to us when you use the `summary()` function.  Let's go back to the model *lm1*

```{r}
summary(lm1)
```

"Multiple R-squared" gives the value $R^2$ of 0.113.

<br>

<p class="comment", style="font-style:normal">**Question 7**: If you were trying to explain the $R^2$ value 0.102 to your educated mother-in-law, what would you say? </p>

<br>

You're done. [Good job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB7IAXrCkO8).
