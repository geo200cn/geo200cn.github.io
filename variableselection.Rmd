In choosing a predictive model, you might want to run different types of models - say, logistic vs. linear regression - and use the cross validation techniques we learned from last lab to choose the model that provides the best predictions. Rather than choosing between different models of varying specification, suppose that we have available a set of variables to predict an outcome of interest and want to choose a subset of those variables that accurately predict the outcome. That is, you have decided on the type of model, and want to select the set of variables among a large pool that provides the best prediction. The driving force behind variable selection is the desire for a parsimonious regression model (one that is simpler and easier to interpret) and the need for greater accuracy in prediction. In this lab guide, we will go through variable selection methods. 

The objectives of this lab are as follows

1. Learn how to run forward and backward stepwise selection
2. Learn how to run ridge and lasso regression

To help us accomplish these objectives, we will use a data set from the 2017 [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) (BRFSS), an annual survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that collects state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services, to examine the association between individual health status and a set of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The lab follows closely this weekâ€™s readings in ISLR.

## **Installing and loading packages**
\

We'll be using a few new packages in this lab.  First, install them if you haven't already.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("leaps", "glmnet"))
```

Second, load all necessary packages.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(broom)
library(dismo)
library(boot)
library(tidyverse)
library(leaps)
library(glmnet)
```


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Bring in the data**
\

Download the data for this lab guide from Canvas in the Week 8 Lab and Assignment folder.  Bring in the BRFSS file *brfss17.csv* file into R.


```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
brfss17 <- read_csv("brfss17.csv")
```


The data contain individuals as units of observations. Here, we'll predict the numeric variable *physhlth*, which gives the number of days in the past month that respondents felt that they were not in good physical health.  Our independent variables are age *agec*, gender *male*, educational attainment *educ*, race/ethnicity *race_eth*, whether the individual indicates they *smoke*, employment status *employ*, marital status *marst*, BMI *bmi*, health insurance *ins*, income *inc*, and indicators of whether the individual has high blood pressure *bphigh*, high cholesterol *toldhi*, and was ever diagnosed with a heart attack *cvdinfr*, a Stroke *cvdstrk*, Asthma *asthma*, Arthritis *havarth*, or Diabetes *diabete*.   A record layout of the data can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geo200cn/data/master/brfss17RL.txt).

Our research question is: What set of variables provide the best predictive quality of a person's physical health? 
 

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Subset Selection**
\

Subset selection refers to the task of finding a small subset of the available independent variables that does a good job of predicting the dependent variable. We then fit a statistical model using just the reduced set of variables.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Forward and Backward Stepwise Selection**
\

The purpose of forward and backward stepwise selection is to iteratively fit a regression model by  adding predictors one-by-one to a model with no variables (known as a null model) or subtracting predictors one-by-one from a full model (all predictors are included).  The goal is to find the best combination of predictors, where best is based on some measure of predictive quality.

We can use the `regsubsets()` function, which is a part of the **leaps** package, to perform the best subset selection methods described in ISLR Ch 6.1.  Let's first run a forward stepwise selection (see ISLR 6.1.2) to find the best predictors for poor physical health days.   The syntax is the same as `lm()` and `glm()`, but we add the argument `method = "forward"` to indicate forward stepwise selection.

```{r}
regfit1.fwd <- regsubsets(physhlth ~ bmi + race_eth + agec + male + smoke + educ + 
                            inc + employ + marst + ins + bphigh + toldhi + 
                            cvdinfr + cvdstrk + asthma + havarth + diabete, 
                          data = brfss17, 
                          method = "forward")
```

A summary of results.

```{r}
summary(regfit1.fwd)
```

The `regsubsets()` function identifies the best model that contains a given number of predictors, where *best* is quantified as the lowest residual sum of squares (RSS).  An asterisk indicates that a given variable is included in the corresponding best model.  For example, the summary output indicates that the best two-variable model contains *employunable* and *havarth*. When interpreting these results, remember that categorical/qualitative variables are separated into dummy variables. Therefore, the variables *employnilf*, *employretired* and *employunable* correspond to separate dummies for the categories "not in labor force", "retired", and "unable to work" (the category "Employed" is the reference) in the *employ* variable.  

You can extract the coefficients and their values for the best j-variable model by using the `coef()` function. For example, to get the coefficients for the best 2-variable model, type in:

```{r}
coef(regfit1.fwd, 2)
```


By  default, the function only reports results up to the best eight-variable model, but you can use the `nvmax` option to return as many variables as desired. For example, let's try a 33 variable model, with 33 representing the max number of predictors we can include in a model.

```{r}
regfit2.fwd <- regsubsets(physhlth ~ bmi + race_eth + agec + male + smoke + educ + 
                            inc + employ + marst + ins + bphigh + toldhi +
                            cvdinfr + cvdstrk + asthma + havarth + diabete, 
                          data = brfss17, 
                          method = "forward", 
                          nvmax = 33)
```

After getting the best model for each given number of predictors, we need to then select the best model across all sets 1 through `nvmax`.  Following ISLR, we can examine the adjusted $R^2$, $Cp$ and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) from the `summary()` output.  Let's examine the adjusted $R^2$, which is discussed on page 212 in ISLR. Let's save a summary of the model in an object, and then extract the adjusted $R^2$ use base R convention.

```{r}
regfit2.fwd.summary <- summary(regfit2.fwd)
regfit2.fwd.summary$adjr2
```

We see that the adjusted $R^2$ increases from 12.8 with one variable to 21.6 with all variables. 

We can look at all fit indicators to decide which model is the best. Plotting adjusted $R^2$, $Cp$, and BIC for all of the models at once can help us decide which model to select. We'll use the basic `plot()` function here, and note the `type="l"` option tells R to connect the plotted points with lines.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(regfit2.fwd.summary$adjr2 , 
     xlab =" Number of Variables ", 
     ylab =" Adjusted RSq ", type ="l")

plot(regfit2.fwd.summary$cp, 
     xlab =" Number of Variables ", 
     ylab ="Cp", 
     type ='l')

plot(regfit2.fwd.summary$bic ,
     xlab =" Number of Variables ",
     ylab =" BIC ", 
     type ='l')
```

### **Cross-validation error**
\

We just saw that it is possible to choose among a set of models of different sizes using BIC, adjusted $R^2$ and other best fit metrics. We will now consider how to do this within a cross-validation framework. Here, you will use cross-validation to find the best model with the lowest validation error. This will combine the methods from ISLR Chapter 5 and Chapter 6, which is described on page 213 in ISLR.

We will choose among the best models of different sizes using cross validation. This approach is somewhat involved, as we must perform subset selection within each of the *k* training sets. Despite this, subsetting in R makes this job quite easy. First, we create a vector that allocates each observation to one of *k* = 10 folds using the fabulous function `kfold()`. We set the seed for reproducability. 

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
brfss17 <- brfss17 %>%
            mutate(folds = kfold(brfss17, k = 10))
table(brfss17$folds)
```

and we create an empty matrix named *cv.errors* in which we will store the results. Rows represent the k = 10 folds and columns represent the complete set of variables (33) we are including in the model (so first column is for the 1-variable model, second is the 2-variable model and so on).
 
```{r}
k=10
cv.errors = matrix(NA ,k,33, dimnames =list(NULL , paste (1:33) ))
cv.errors 
```

Now we write a for loop that performs cross-validation. The loop is similar to the one we used to do cross-validation on California temperature in the [last lab](https://geo200cn.github.io/prediction.html#Cross-Validation). In the $k$th fold, the  elements of folds that equal *k* are in the test (or validation) set, and the remainder are in the training set. We make our predictions for each model size, compute the test errors on the appropriate subset, and store them in the appropriate slot in the matrix *cv.errors*.

There is a complication: there is no `predict()` method for `regsubsets()` like there is for `glm()` or `lm()`. Fortunately, ISLR created a predict function for us to use for `regsubsets()` objects. I copy and paste their code below. If you would like to learn how this function was created, see ISLR 6.5.3.

```{r}
predict.regsubsets = function(object ,newdata ,id ,...) {
 form =as.formula(object$call[[2]])
 mat = model.matrix(form, newdata )
 coefi =coef(object ,id=id)
 xvars = names(coefi)
 mat [, xvars ]%*%coefi
}
```

Now the for loop. Remember, for each fold k, we need to run the forward stepwise regression, and then for each best model of 1, 2, ... 33 variables, we make the prediction. So, we have a 10 (fold) by 33 (models) matrix of error rates.

```{r}
for (j in 1:k){
  best.fit = regsubsets(physhlth ~ bmi + race_eth + agec + male + smoke + 
                          educ + inc + employ + marst + ins + bphigh + 
                          toldhi + cvdinfr + cvdstrk + asthma + havarth + 
                          diabete,
                        data = filter(brfss17, folds != j), 
                        method = "forward", 
                        nvmax = 33)
  for (i in 1:33) {
    pred= predict.regsubsets(best.fit , filter(brfss17, folds == j), id=i)
    pred2 <- (dplyr::select(filter(brfss17, folds == j), physhlth) - pred)^2
    cv.errors[j,i]= mean(pred2$physhlth)
    }
}
```

This has given us a 10Ã—33 matrix, of which the *(i, j)*th element corresponds to the test MSE for the ith cross-validation fold for the best *j*-variable model. We use the `apply()` function to average over the columns of this matrix in order to obtain a vector for which the *j*th element is the cross-validation error for the *j*-variable model (see more about the apply function [here](https://rspatial.org/intr/9-apply.html)).

```{r}
mean.cv.errors =apply(cv.errors ,2, mean)
mean.cv.errors
```

The model with the lowest error rate is

```{r}
min(mean.cv.errors)
```

which corresponds to the 28-variable model.  Let's plot to visualize

```{r}
par(mfrow =c(1 ,1))
plot( mean.cv.errors , type='b')
```

<p class="comment">**Question 3**: What are the variables and their coefficient values associated with the 28-variable model?   </p>

<br>


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Shrinkage Methods**
\

The basis behind shrinkage methods is to shrink the coefficients towards 0. Why would shrunk coefficients be better? This introduces bias, but may significantly decrease the variance of the estimates. If the latter effect is larger, this would decrease the test error. The driving force behind variable selection: the need for greater accuracy in prediction. In a prediction context, there is less concern about the values of the components on the right-hand side, rather interest is on the total contribution. We'll cover two shrinkage methods: ridge and lasso regression.  If you want to dig deep into the math, check ISLR Ch. 6.2.  Otherwise, follow the conceptual pathway rather than getting too deep (or lost) in the weeds.


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Ridge and Lasso Regression**
\

We can fit ridge and lasso regression models using the function `glmnet()` which is a part of the **glmnet** package.  This function has slightly different syntax from other model-fitting functions that we have encountered thus far in this class (e.g. `lm()`, `glm()`, `lagsarlm()`).  In particular, we must pass in a matrix *x* of independent variables rather than a data frame as well as a *y* vector.  

The `model.matrix()` function is particularly useful for creating *x*; not only does it produce a matrix corresponding to the 33 predictors but it also automatically transforms any qualitative variables into dummy variables. The latter property is important because `glmnet()` can only take numerical, quantitative inputs. Create *x* using `model.matrix()` and set *y* as the response variable *brfss17$physhlth*.

```{r}
x <- model.matrix(physhlth ~., dplyr::select(brfss17, physhlth, bmi, race_eth, 
                                             agec, male, smoke , educ, inc, employ, 
                                             marst, ins, bphigh, toldhi, cvdinfr, 
                                             cvdstrk, asthma, havarth, diabete))[, -1]
y <- brfss17$physhlth
```


We've got our pieces to plug into `glmnet()`. The function has an alpha argument that determines what type of model is fit. If `alpha=0` then a ridge regression model is fit, and if `alpha=1` then a lasso model is fit.  We also need to specify the argument `lambda`.

```{r}
grid <-10^seq(10,-2, length =100)
regfit.ridge = glmnet(x,y,alpha =0, lambda =grid )
```

Recall from ISLR 6.2.3, lambda is our key tuning parameter. By default the `glmnet()` function performs ridge regression for an automatically selected range of `lambda` values. However, here we have chosen to implement the function over a grid of 100 values ranging from `lambda` = $10^10$ to `lambda` = $10^{âˆ’2}$. As we will see, we can also compute model fits for a particular value of lambda that is not one of the original grid values. Note that by default, the `glmnet()` function standardizes the variables so that they are on the same scale. To turn off this default setting, use the argument `standardize = FALSE`.

Associated with each value of lambda is a vector of ridge regression coefficients, stored in a matrix that can be accessed by `coef()`. In this case, it is a 34Ã—100 matrix, with 34 rows (one for each predictor, plus an intercept) and 100 columns (one for each value of lambda).

```{r}
dim(coef(regfit.ridge))
```

As ISLR describes, we expect the coefficient estimates to be much smaller when a large value of lambda is used, as compared to when a small value of lambda is used. These are the coefficients when lambda = 11498

```{r}
regfit.ridge$lambda[50]
coef(regfit.ridge)[,50]
```

In contrast, here are the coefficients when lambda = 705.

```{r}
regfit.ridge$lambda[60]
coef(regfit.ridge)[,60]
```

OK, so which lambda do we go with? In general, instead of arbitrarily choosing a lambda, it would be better to use our new best pal cross-validation to choose the value of this tuning parameter. This is described on page 227 in ISLR.  Instead of running a for loop, we can do this using the built-in cross-validation function, `cv.glmnet()`. By default, the function `cv.glmnet()` performs ten-fold cross-validation, though this can be changed using the argument `folds`. Note that we set a random seed first so our results will be reproducible, because the choice of the cross-validation folds is random.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
cv.out =cv.glmnet(x,y, alpha =0, lambda = grid)
```

We can plot the mean squared error by lambda

```{r}
plot(cv.out)
```

But let's get the lambda that minimizes the error.

```{r}
bestlam =cv.out$lambda.min
bestlam
```

We see that the value of lambda that results in the smallest cross-validation error is 0.03053856. 

We've got our best lambda, now we fit the ridge regression. 

```{r}
out <- glmnet(x,y,alpha =0, lambda = bestlam)
```

The ridge regression coefficients for our new value of lambda is

```{r}
coef(out)
```

Unlike stepwise regression, which controls the complexity of the model by restricting the number of predictors, ridge regression keeps all of the predictor variables in the model, and shrinks the coefficients toward zero.

Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) performs variable selection and regularization to increase prediction accuracy of the modelâ€¦the only difference to ridge is that the regularization term is an absolute value. So instead of squaring the slope, which is done in ridge regression, we take the absolute value. As a result Lasso regression can increase lambda then set irrelevant parameters to 0 (Ridge will just shrink them but not set to 0) â€” relevant parameters might shrink a little bit in both too. The advantage here is that Lasso can exclude useless variables â€” so if you have a lot of variables it might be preferable. However, if most variables are useful then Ridge regression would probably work better.


The above procedure uses cross-validation to decide which lambda to choose.  But what if you wanted to decide whether ridge regression is better than our other shrinkage method, the lasso? You can separate your data set into training and test sets, run each model on the training set, and then calculate RMSE or MSE using the test sets.  

<br>

<p class="comment">**Question 4**: Use 10-fold cross validation to find the best value of the tuning parameter for Lasso regression.</p>


<p class="comment">**Question 5**:  Using the tuning parameter we identified in the lab guide for Ridge and the one you identified in Question 4 for Lasso, use 10-fold cross validation to choose between Ridge and Lasso regression models based on RMSE? Use the RMSE function you created in last lab to calculate the RMSE. Hint: You will be using similar code from last lab to calculate 10 RMSEs for each model, take the mean of the 10 RMSEs, and compare this mean between Ridge and Lasso. Note that unlike `regsubsets()`, the regular `predict()` function works for `glmnet()`.</p>
