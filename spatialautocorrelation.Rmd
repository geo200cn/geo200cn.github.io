[Tobler's First Law of Geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobler%27s_first_law_of_geography) states that "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."  The law is capturing the concept of spatial autocorrelation.  We will be covering the R functions and tools that measure spatial autocorrelation, closely following OSU Chapters 7 and 8. The objectives of the guide are as follows

1. Learn how to create a spatial weights matrix
2. Learn how to create a Moran scatterplot
3. Calculate global spatial autocorrelation
4. Detect clusters using local spatial autocorrelation

To help us accomplish these learning objectives, we will examine air pollution levels in the [Sacramento Metropolitan Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_metropolitan_area).

## **Installing and loading packages**
\

We'll be introducing one new package in this lab: **spdep**.  This package contains functions for estimating spatial autocorrelation. Install the package.


```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("spdep")
```

The other packages we need should be pretty familiar to you at this point. Load these packages and our new package using `library()`


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(spdep)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
```


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

## **Why measure spatial autocorrelation**
\

Last lab we dealt with the spatial clustering of points. This lab we're dealing with the spatial clustering of polygons. Or more precisely, the spatial clustering of attributes across polygons. Think about the types of real world geographic objects we can represent with polygons. Neighborhoods are one. People live in neighborhoods. Policy deploys important economic resources at the [neighborhood level](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/opportunity-zones-frequently-asked-questions). We might then be interested in whether certain phenomena, such as poverty or housing displacement are clustered across neighborhoods in a city. Why? Because concentrations of poverty are harder to break up than pockets it of it. Measuring segregation is another good application of clustering.  People talk about segregation [all](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/01/african-american-atlantic-city-segregation-northside-tourism/580576/) [the](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rothstein-segregated-housing-20170820-story.html) [time](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/opinion/school-segregation-nyc.html). But, it is often talked  about in very colloquial or imprecise ways. Well, we have actual (geographic) methods to quantify the degree of segregation in a city.  If you study soils, perhaps your polygons are plots of land.  Are healthy plots clustered? You don't even need to have administrative boundaries or designated plots of lands to measure spatial autocorrelation. For example, [Diniz-Filho, Bini and Hawkins (2003)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1466-822X.2003.00322.x) use equal sized cells to measure the clustering of species diversity in Western Paleartic birds.

Similar to the point pattern analysis guide, we won't go into the methods that help us *explain* why something is clustered.  We're just trying to descriptively understand whether our variable of interest is clustered, what is the size or magnitude of the clustering, and where that clustering occurs

Our research questions in this lab are: Do air pollution levels cluster in the Sacramento Metropolitan Area? Where do air pollution levels cluster? Does air pollution concentration differ from the spatial clustering of other environmental hazards?


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Bringing in the data**
\

Let's bring in our main dataset for the lab, a shapefile named *sacmetrotracts.shp*, which contains a standard measure of air pollution exposure, [PM 2.5.](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics), for census tracts in the Sacramento Metropolitan Area, taken from the [CalEnviroScreen](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-40). The data set also contains a variable measuring [Childrenâ€™s Lead Risk from Housing](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/indicator/childrens-lead-risk-housing) as well as one measuring [pesticide use used on agricultural commodities](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/indicator/pesticide-use).   I zipped up the file and uploaded it onto Github.  Set your working directory to an appropriate folder and use the following code to download and unzip the file. 


```{r eval = FALSE}
#insert the pathway to the folder you want your data stored into
setwd("insert your pathway here")
#downloads file into your working directory 
download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geo200cn/data/master/sacmetrotracts.zip", destfile = "sacmetrotracts.zip")
#unzips the zipped file
unzip(zipfile = "sacmetrotracts.zip")
```


You should see the *sacmetrotracts* files in your current working directory (check `getwd()` to see where your data were downloaded). Bring in the shape file using `st_read()`. 


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "hide"}
sac.tracts <- st_read("sacmetrotracts.shp")
```

We'll need to reproject the file into a [Coordinate Reference System](https://rspatial.org/spatial/6-crs.html) that uses meters as the units of distance. Let's use [UTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system) Zone 10. We use the **sf** function `st_transform()` to reproject.


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sac.tracts <- sac.tracts %>%
            st_transform(crs = "+proj=utm +zone=10 +datum=NAD83 +ellps=GRS80") 
```



<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Exploratory mapping**
\

Before we calculate spatial autocorrelation, we should first map our variable of interest to see if it *looks* like it clusters across space.  Using the function `tm_shape()`, here is a choropleth map using quantile breaks of PM 2.5 levels in the Sacramento metro area.  


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
tm_shape(sac.tracts, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "PM2_5", style = "quantile",palette = "Reds", 
              title = "") +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 10, 20), text.size = 1, position = c("left", "bottom")) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "PM 2.5 levels in Sacramento Metropolitan Area Tracts",  
            main.title.size = 0.95, frame = FALSE)
```
  
It does look like air pollution levels cluster.  In particular, there appears to be a concentration of high PM 2.5. neighborhoods in downtown Sacramento and south Sacramento, and low PM 2.5. areas in the eastern portion of the metro area. What about Lead exposure?

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
tm_shape(sac.tracts, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "Lead", style = "quantile",palette = "Reds", 
              title = "") +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 10, 20), text.size = 1, position = c("left", "bottom")) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Lead Risk in Sacramento Metropolitan Area Tracts",  
            main.title.size = 0.95, frame = FALSE)
```

Do you see any noticeable differences in where Lead exposure risk clusters? 


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Spatial weights matrix**
\

Before we can formally model the dependency shown in the above maps, we must first establish how neighborhoods are spatially connected to one another.  That is, what does "near" mean when we say "near things are more related than distant things"?   You need to define

1. Neighbor connectivity (who is you neighbor?)
2. Neighbor weights (how much does your neighbor matter?)

A discussion of the spatial weights matrix is provided at the start of page 200 in OSU.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Neighbor connectivity: Contiguity**
\

Sharing a border and/or vertex is a common way of defining a neighbor.  The two most common ways of defining contiguity is Rook and Queen adjacency (Figure 1).  Rook adjacency refers to neighbors that share a line segment.  Queen adjacency refers to neighbors that share a line segment (or border) or a point (or vertex).


<center>
![Figure 1: Geographic contiguity](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/GEO 200CN/lab/geo200cn.github.io/fig1.png)

</center>

<br>

Neighbor relationships in R are represented by neighbor *nb* objects.  An *nb* object identifies the neighbors for each feature in the dataset.  We use the command `poly2nb()` from the **spdep** package to create a contiguity-based neighbor object.   Let's specify Queen adjacency. 


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sacb<-poly2nb(sac.tracts, queen=T)
```

You plug the object *sac.tracts* into the first argument of `poly2nb()` and then specify Queen contiguity using the argument `queen=T`. To get Rook adjacency, change the argument to `queen=F`. 

The function `summary()` tells us something about how much the neighborhoods are connected.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
summary(sacb)
```

The average number of neighbors (adjacent polygons) is 6.3, 1 polygon has 1 neighbor and 1 has 18 neighbors.



<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Neighbor connectivity: Distance**
\

In distance based connectivity, features within a given radius are considered to be neighbors. The length of the radius is left up to the researcher to decide. For example, [Weisburd, Groff and Yang (2012)](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195369083.001.0001/acprof-9780195369083) use a quarter mile (approximately 3-4 city blocks) in their study of crime clusters in Seattle. Often studies test different distances to test the robustness of the findings (e.g. [Poulsen et al. 2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/a42181)). When dealing with polygons, x and y are the coordinates of their centroids (the center of the polygon). You create a radius of distance *d2* around the observation of interest - other polygons whose centroids fall inside this radius are tagged as neighbors. 

<center>
![Figure 2: Distance based](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/GEO 200CN/lab/geo200cn.github.io/fig3.png)

</center>


Other distance metrics besides Euclidean are possible depending on the context and area of your subject. For example, Manhattan distance, which uses the road network rather than the straight line measure of Euclidean distance, is often used in city planning and transportation research.

You create a distance based neighbor object using using the function `dnearneigh()`, which is a part of the **spdep** package. The `dnearneigh()` function tells R to designate as neighbors the units falling within the distance specified between `d1` (lower distance bound) and `d2` (upper distance bound). Note that `d1` and `d2` can be any distance value as long as they reflect the distance units that our shapefile is projected in (meters for UTM). The option `x` gives the geographic coordinates of each feature in your shapefile which allows R to calculate distances between each feature to every other feature in the dataset.  We use the coordinates of neighborhood centroids to calculate distances from one neighborhood to another. First, letâ€™s extract the centroids using `st_centroid()`. 


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#extract tract coordinates
sac.coords <- st_centroid(sac.tracts)
```

Using `dnearneigh()`, we create a distance based nearest neighbor object where `d2` is 20 miles (32186.9 meters). `d1` will equal 0. `row.names =` specifies the unique ID for each polygon.

  

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
Sacnb_dist1 <- dnearneigh(sac.coords, d1 = 0, d2 = 32186.9, 
                          row.names = sac.tracts$GEOID)
```


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Neighbor connectivity: k-nearest neighbors**
\

Another common method for defining neighbors is k-nearest neighbors. This will find the k closest observations for each observation of interest, where k is some integer. For instance, if we define k=3, then each observation will have 3 neighbors, which are the 3 closest observations to it, regardless of the distance between them. Using the k-nearest neighbor rule, two observations could potentially be very far apart and still be considered neighbors.

<center>
![Figure 3: k-nearest neighbors: k = 3](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/GEO 200CN/lab/geo200cn.github.io/fig2.png)

</center>


You create a k-nearest neighbor object using the commands `knearneigh()`and `knn2nb()`. First, create a k nearest neighbor object using `knearneigh()` by plugging in the tract coordinates and specifying *k*.  Then create an *nb* object by plugging in the object created by `knearneigh()` into `knn2nb()`. 

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Neighbor weights**
\

We've established who our neighbors are by creating an *nb* object.  The next step is to assign weights to each neighbor relationship. The weight determines *how much* each neighbor counts.  You will need to use the `nb2listw()` command to create the weights matrix. Let's create weights for our Queen contiguity defined neighbor object *sacb*.  


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sacw<-nb2listw(sacb, style="W", zero.policy= TRUE)
```

In the command, you first put in your neighbor *nb* object (*sacb*) and then define the weights `style = "W"`. Here, `style = "W"` indicates that the weights for each spatial unit are standardized to sum to 1 (this is known as row standardization).  For example, the census tract in row 1 has 7 neighbors, and each of those neighbors will have weights of 1/7. 



```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sacw$weights[[1]]
```


This allows for comparability between areas with different numbers of neighbors.

The argument `zero.policy= TRUE` deals with situations when an area has no neighbors based on your definition of neighbor (one example is [Catalina Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Californian_Channel_Islands_map_en.png) in Southern California).  When this happens and you don't include `zero.policy= TRUE`, you'll get the following error 

<br>

````
Error in nb2listw(countyb, style = "W") : Empty neighbour sets found
````

<br>


We can visualize the neighbor connections between tracts using the weight matrix created from `nb2listw()`. We use the generic `plot()` function to create these visuals. Here are the connections for the Queen contiguity based definition of neighbor.


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
centroids <- st_centroid(st_geometry(sac.tracts))
plot(st_geometry(sac.tracts), border = "grey60", reset = FALSE)
plot(sacb, coords = centroids, add=T, col = "red")
```


Let's create the spatial weights matrix for the 20 mile distance


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
Sacw_dist1<-nb2listw(Sacnb_dist1, style="W", zero.policy= TRUE)
```

The plot of connections for the 20 mile distance based neighbor object and weights matrix yields.


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
plot(st_geometry(sac.tracts), border = "grey60", reset = FALSE)
plot(Sacw_dist1, coords = centroids, add=T, col = "red")
```

Notice the difference in the number and density of ties represented in the two maps.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Moran Scatterplot**
\

We've now defined what we mean by neighbor by creating an *nb* object and the influence of each neighbor by creating a spatial weights matrix.  The first map we created in this guide showed that PM 2.5. levels appear to be clustered in Sacramento. We can visually explore this a little more by plotting standardized PM 2.5 on the x-axis and the standardized average PM 2.5 of one's neighbors (also known as the spatial lag) on the y-axis.  This plot is known as a Moran scatterplot, and it's described on pages 207-208 in OSU.  Let's create one using the Queen based spatial weights matrix.   Fortunately, **spdep** has the function `moran.plot()` to help us out. Note that the function is not **tidyverse** friendly, so we revert to the base `$` convention to call up the variable.


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
moran.plot(sac.tracts$PM2_5, listw=sacw, xlab="Standardized PM 2.5", ylab="Standardized Lagged PM 2.5",
main=c("Moran Scatterplot for PM 2.5"),
zero.policy= TRUE)
```


Looks like a fairly strong positive association - the higher your neighbors' average PM 2.5, the higher your PM 2.5.  How does it visually compare to Lead exposure?

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
moran.plot(sac.tracts$Lead, listw=sacw, xlab="Standardized Lead Exposure", ylab="Standardized Lagged Lead Exposure",
main=c("Moran Scatterplot for Lead Expsure"),
zero.policy= TRUE)
```

What is the slope of the best fit line for a Moran scatterplot?

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Global spatial autocorrelation**
\

The map and Moran scatterplot provide descriptive visualizations of clustering (autocorrelation) in PM 2.5.  But, rather than eyeballing the correlation, we need a quantitative and objective approach to quantifying the degree to which similar features cluster.  This is where global measures of spatial autocorrelation step in.  A global index of spatial autocorrelation provides a summary over the entire study area of the level of spatial similarity observed among neighboring observations.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Moran's I**
\

The most popular test of spatial autocorrelation is the Global Moranâ€™s I test, which is discussed on page 205 in OSU.  Use the command `moran.test()` in the **spdep** package to calculate the Moran's I.  Within this function, you specify the variable from the **sf** object and the spatial weights matrix. Let's calculate Moran's I for PM 2.5 using our Queen contiguity spatial weights matrix *sacw*. Note that the function is not **tidyverse** friendly.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
moran.test(sac.tracts$PM2_5, sacw)    
```


We find that the Moran's I is positive (0.92) and statistically significant (p-value < 0.01). Remember from OSU that the Moran's I is simply a correlation, and correlations go from -1 to 1.  A 0.92 correlation is high - OSU uses a rule of thumb of correlations higher than 0.3 and lower than -0.3 as meaningful.  Moreover, we find that this correlation is statistically significant (p-value basically at 0).

We can compute a p-value from a Monte Carlo simulation as is discussed on page 208 in OSU using the `moran.mc()` function.  


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
moran.mc(sac.tracts$PM2_5, sacw, nsim=999, zero.policy= TRUE)
```



The only difference between `moran.test()` and `moran.mc()` is that we need to set `nsim=` in the latter, which specifies the number of random simulations to run.  We end up with a p-value of 0.001.  You can use the distance and k-nearest neighbor based definitions to test how sensitive the results are to different definitions of neighbor. 

Is the clustering of air pollution levels greater than the clustering of Lead exposure?

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
moran.mc(sac.tracts$Lead, sacw, nsim=999, zero.policy= TRUE)
```

What about pesticide use?

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
moran.mc(sac.tracts$Pesticide, sacw, nsim=999, zero.policy= TRUE)
```


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Geary's c**
\

Another popular index of global spatial autocorrelation is Geary's c which is a cousin to the Moran's I. Similar to Moran's I, it is best to test the statistical significance of Geary's c using a Monte Carlo simulation. You use `geary.mc()` to calculate Geary's c.  OSU discusses Geary's c on page 211.

```{r}
geary.mc(sac.tracts$PM2_5, sacw, nsim = 999)
```

Compared to Lead and Pesticide use

```{r}
geary.mc(sac.tracts$Lead, sacw, nsim = 999)
geary.mc(sac.tracts$Pesticide, sacw, nsim = 999)
```


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Local spatial autocorrelation**
\

The Moran's I tells us whether clustering exists in the area.  It does not tell us, however, *where* clusters are located.  These issues led Geographers to consider local forms of the global indices, known as Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISAs).

LISAs have the primary goal of providing a local measure of similarity between each unit's value (in our case, PM 2.5) and those of nearby cases.  That is, rather than one single summary measure of spatial association (Moran's I), we have a measure for every single unit in the study area.  We can then map each tract's LISA value to provide insight into the location of neighborhoods with comparatively high or low associations with neighboring values (i.e. hot or cold spots).

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Getis-Ord**
\

A popular local measure of spatial autocorrelation is Getis-Ord, which is discussed on page 219 in OSU.  There are two versions of the Getis-Ord, $G_i$ and $G_i^*$.  $G_i$ only uses neighbors to calculate hot and cold spots whereas $G_i^*$ includes the location itself in the calculation. 

Let's calculate $G_i^*$.  To do this, we need to use the `include.self()` function. We use this function on *sacb* to create an *nb* object that includes the location itself as one of the neighbors.  


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sacb.self <- include.self(sacb)
```

We then plug this new self-included *nb* object into `nb2listw()` to create a self-included spatial weights object


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sac.w.self <- nb2listw(sacb.self, style="W", zero.policy= TRUE)
```

We calculate $G_i^*$ for each tract using the function `localG()` which is part of the **spdep** package. You plug in the variable you want to find clusters for and the self-included spatial weights object `sac.w.self()`. Let's do this for PM 2.5 levels. Note that the function is not **tidyverse** friendly.


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
localgstar<-localG(sac.tracts$PM2_5, sac.w.self, zero.policy = TRUE)
```


The command returns a *localG* object containing the Z-scores for the $G_i^*$ statistic. 


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
summary(localgstar)
```


Local Getis-Ord has returned z-scores between -13.67204 and 3.89400.  This statistic can describe where hot and cold spots cluster. The interpretation of the Z-score is straightforward: a large positive value suggests a cluster of high PM 2.5 (*hot spot*) and a large negative value indicates a cluster of low PM 2.5 (*cold spot*). 

In order to plot the results, you'll need to coerce the object *localgstar* to be numeric.  

```{r}
class(localgstar)
```

Let's do this using `as.numeric()` and save the numeric vector into our **sf** object *sac.tracts*. 


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sac.tracts <- sac.tracts %>%
                mutate(localgstar = as.numeric(localgstar))
```

We can create a map of the $G_i^*$ values like OSU does in Figure 8.1 on page 221 (their map is for the regular $G_i$).  We'll break up the values by quintile.


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
tm_shape(sac.tracts, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "localgstar", title = "Gi* value", palette = "-RdBu", style = "quantile") +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 10, 20), text.size = 1) +
  tm_layout(frame = F, main.title = "Sacramento PM 2.5.",
            legend.outside = T) 
```


You show more spread of $G_i^*$  by showing deciles


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
tm_shape(sac.tracts, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "localgstar", title = "Gi* value", palette = "-RdBu", style = "quantile", n=10) +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 10, 20), text.size = 1) +
  tm_layout(frame = F, main.title = "Sacramento PM 2.5.",
            legend.outside = T) 
```


The argument `palette = "-RdBu"` reverses the colors such that higher values are red (hot) and lower values are blue (cold). 

The values you get from `localG()` are Z scores. We might interpret Z scores outside -1.96 and 1.96 as unusual cases, or statistically significant hot spots at the 95% level (remember that -1.96 and 1.96 represent the values on the standard normal distribution that correspond to a 95% confidence interval).  However, OSU on page 221 warns that normality in the distribution of local statistics is often not met.  Nevertheless, let's see where hot and cold spots are located using Z values that are associated with 99, 95 and 90 percent confidence intervals. 


Below we use the function `case_when()` to categorize hot and cold spots based on different significance levels (1% (or 99%), 5% (or 95%), and 10% (or 90%)) using the appropriate Z-scores. We then set the categorical variable as a factor, ordering the levels from cold to not significant to hot.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sac.tracts <- sac.tracts %>%
                mutate(hotspotsg = case_when(
                  localgstar <= -2.58 ~ "Cold spot 99%",
                  localgstar > -2.58 & localgstar <=-1.96 ~ "Cold spot 95%",
                  localgstar > -1.96 & localgstar <= -1.65 ~ "Cold spot 90%",
                  localgstar >= 1.65 & localgstar < 1.96 ~ "Hot spot 90%",
                  localgstar >= 1.96 & localgstar <= 2.58 ~ "Hot spot 95%",
                  localgstar >= 2.58 ~ "Hot spot 99%",
                  TRUE ~ "Not Significant"))

#coerce into a factor, and sort levels from cold to not significant to hot
sac.tracts <- sac.tracts %>%
              mutate(hotspotsg = factor(hotspotsg,
                                  levels = c("Cold spot 99%", "Cold spot 95%",
                                             "Cold spot 90%", "Not Significant",
                                            "Hot spot 90%", "Hot spot 95%",
                                            "Hot spot 99%")))
```



Then map the clusters using `tm_shape()` using a blue, white and red color palette.


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
tm_shape(sac.tracts, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "hotspotsg", title = "", palette = c("blue","white", "red")) +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 10, 20), text.size = 1) +
  tm_layout(frame = F, main.title = "Sacramento PM 2.5",
            legend.outside = T) 
```


We can also eliminate the different significance levels and simply designate hot and cold spots as tracts with Z-scores above 1.96 and below -1.96 (95% significance level).


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sac.tracts <- sac.tracts %>%
                mutate(hotspotsgs95 = case_when(
                  localgstar <=-1.96 ~ "Cold spot",
                  localgstar >= 1.96  ~ "Hot spot",
                  TRUE ~ "Not Significant"),
                  hotspotsgs95 = factor(hotspotsgs95,
                                  levels = c("Cold spot", 
                                             "Not Significant",
                                             "Hot spot")))
```

And then map. We save the map in an object named *sac.pm25.map.g*.


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sac.pm25.map.g <- tm_shape(sac.tracts, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "hotspotsgs95", title = "", palette = c("blue","white", "red")) +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 10, 20), text.size = 1) +
  tm_layout(frame = F, main.title = "Sacramento PM 2.5",
            legend.outside = T) 

sac.pm25.map.g
```


Let's put it into an interactive map.  Where do high and low PM 2.5 neighborhoods cluster? Zoom in and find out.


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
tmap_mode("view")
sac.pm25.map.g + tm_view()
```

Run Getis-Ord for Lead exposure and determine whether its local clusters overlap with PM 2.5 hot and cold spots.

### **Local Moran's I**
\

Another popular measure of local spatial autocorrelation is the local Moran's I, which is discussed on page 222 in OSU.  We can calculate the local Moran's I using the command `localmoran_perm()` found in the **spdep** package. First, a random number seed is set given that we are using the conditional permutation approach to calculating statistical significance. This will ensure reproducibility of results when the process is re-run.


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#set random seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1918)

locali<-localmoran_perm(sac.tracts$PM2_5, sacw, nsim = 999) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  set_names(c("local_i", "exp_i", "var_i", "z_i", "p_i",
              "p_i_sim", "pi_sim_folded", "skewness", "kurtosis"))
```

The resulting object is a matrix with the local statistic, the expectation of the local statistic, the variance, the Z score (deviation of the local statistic from the expectation divided by the standard deviation), and the p-value. We transformed the matrix into a tibble using `as_tibble()`, and added appropriate variable names to each column using `set_names()`. 

Save the local statistic and the Z-score into our **sf** object *sac.tracts* for mapping purposes.


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sac.tracts <- sac.tracts %>%
              bind_cols(locali)
```

We have to make our own identifiers for statistically significant clusters.  Let's designate any areas with Z-scores greater than 1.96 or less than -1.96 as high and low clusters, respectively. 


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sac.tracts <- sac.tracts %>%
                mutate(mcluster = case_when(
                  z_i <=-1.96 ~ "Negative Correlation",
                  z_i >= 1.96  ~ "Positive Correlation",
                  TRUE ~ "Not Significant"),
                  mcluster = factor(mcluster,
                                  levels = c("Negative Correlation", 
                                             "Not Significant",
                                             "Positive Correlation")))

```

Now we map!


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#set back to plotting
tmap_mode("plot")

tm_shape(sac.tracts, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "mcluster", title = "", palette = c("blue","white", "red")) +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 10, 20), text.size = 1) +
  tm_layout(frame = F, main.title = "Sacramento PM 2.5",
            legend.outside = T) 
```


Positive values indicate similarity between neighbors while negative values indicate
dissimilarity. This means that high values of $I_i$ indicate that similar values are being clustered. In contrast, low values of $I_i$ indicate that dissimilar (high and low) values are clustered. When working with the local Moran's *I*, you will want to link it back to the four quadrants of the Moran scatterplot where we identified High-High, Low-Low, High-Low, and Low-High clusters (described on page 222 in OSU). This will allow you to create the type of map produced on page 11 in [Scott et al. (2010)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00330120903375837).
