# Linear Regression II

## Question 1

Note: the Q-Q Plot is also known as a normal probability plot. See BBR p 490. On page 491 of BBR, Figure 12-13 shows what a Normal Probability Plot that is near linear might look like. How does it compare?

## Question 2

For sample code, see below Question 2; there, you'll see a residual vs fitted plot for `badreg`. Use that code with the appropriate adjustments.

## Question 3

For the omitted variables plot, simply use the same plot function from Question 2, but replace the x-value with your variable of interest, eg, `zctanyc$medincome`. Be sure to rename the x-axis and the title of the plot! Read more about omitted variables on the bottom of BBR 492.

## Question 4

The bottom paragraph of BBR 503 and the section beginning at the bottom of BBR 508 might be useful.

## Question 5

Again, the bottom of BBR 503 should help.

## Question 6

Remember, the value under `Estimate` is the coefficient of your independent variable, resulting in values of your response variable.

## Question 7

Pay attention to the magnitude.
