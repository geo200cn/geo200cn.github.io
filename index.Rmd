## About the class

This course provides an introduction to quantitative geographic methods with a focus on spatial data manipulation, modeling, and analysis.  Students leaving the course should have gained both methodological skills, and have a stronger sense of the concepts underlying this type of research analysis. Lectures will present abstract statistical concepts alongside data analysis examples motivated through real-world problems.  Labs will provide hands-on practice of the methods covered in lecture and readings using the statistical software program R.
