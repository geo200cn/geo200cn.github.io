In this supplementary guide, you will learn how to use **tidyverse** functions to accomplish various data wrangling tasks. Data wrangling is the process of transforming raw data into a more usable form. It is relatively rare outside of the cloistered setting of a University classroom to have a clean data set ready for analysis. In fact, some [estimate](https://msimonline.ischool.uw.edu/blog/what-is-data-wrangling/) that data wrangling can take upwards of 80% to 90% of your data analysis time.

We will rely on **tidyverse** to demonstrate data wrangling in R because its consistency, together with the goal of increasing productivity, mean that the syntax of tidy functions is typically straightforward to learn.  Because of time constraints, we will not be able to go through all of **tidyverse**'s functions in this guide.  Some you will encounter in the course's lab guides. Others you may need to learn on your own.  The best resource is the book [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) (RDS), which is free online and was written by **tidyverse**'s creators.  You can also go straight to the **tidyverse** official [website](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

## **Tidyverse package**
\

All of **tidyverse**'s functions are located in the package **tidyverse**. If you haven't already done so, install the package.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Remember that you will install packages once and never more (unless you update R).  Next, load the package in your current session using `library()`

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Unlike installing, loading a package using `library()` needs to happen every time you start a new R session.  Install once, never more. Library every time you start R.


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Reading and writing data**
\

Let's bring in some data to help illustrate the use of tidy R functions.  I uploaded a file on GitHub containing the number of Hispanic, white, Asian, and black residents in 2018 in California neighborhoods taken from the United States [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs).   To import this file in R, use the `read_csv()` command

```{r warning=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
neighborhoods <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geo200cn/data/master/week2data.csv")
```

<br>

To write or save data, you would use the function `write_csv()`.

**tidyverse** can read in more than just csv files. It has a suite of `read_` functions that are a part of the subpackage **readr**.  The goal of **readr** is to provide a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf). It is designed to flexibly parse many types of data found in the wild, while still cleanly failing when data unexpectedly changes. To learn more about these functions, see **readr**'s dedicated [site](https://readr.tidyverse.org/index.html).

Note the underscore in between `read` and `csv`.  There is a base R function called `read.csv()`.  What is the difference? The function `read.csv()` stores your data into a regular data frame. The function `read_csv()` stores your data in a special tidy R object - a tibble, which we discuss next. 


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Tibbles**
\

Although the **tidyverse** works with all data objects, its fundamental object type is the tibble. Tibbles are essentially a special variant of [data frames](https://geo200cn.github.io/getting_started.html#Data_Frames) that have desirable properties for printing and joining.  To illustrate comparisons between tibbles and regular data frames, let's bring in the county data we downloaded above but using the base R function `read.csv()`  

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
neighborhoods.df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geo200cn/data/master/week2data.csv")
```


The object *neighborhoods.df* is a regular data frame. The first difference between regular data frames and tibbles is how the dataset "looks."  First, the tibble.

```{r}
neighborhoods
```

Tibbles have a refined print method that shows only the first 10 rows, and only the columns that fit on the screen.  In addition, each column reports its name and type.

Tibbles are designed so that you don't accidentally overwhelm your console when you print large data frames.  Compare the print output above to what you get with a data frame

```{r eval = FALSE}
neighborhoods.df
```

Ugly, right? 

Another important difference between tidy and base R is that `read_csv()` will always read variables containing text as character variables. In contrast, the base R function `read.csv()` will sometimes convert a character variable to a factor. Tidy R figures that if you really wanted a character, you can easily convert it when you load it in. `read_csv()` will also not convert numbers with a leading zero into an integer.  It figures that if you want to convert it into an integer, you can do it after the data are read in.  In contrast, `read.csv()` will assume you want it in an integer.   And you know what they say about [assuming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svkgOsr7pUc).


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Data manipulation**
\

One of the clear advantages of tidy R, at least when you are first learning R, is its assortment of user-friendly data manipulation functions, which is a part of its **dplyr** package. Compared to base R, the beauty of these **dplyr** functions is that they feature consistent design principles and easily work with non-standard evaluation (i.e., you don’t have to put quotes around variable names).


It is rare that the data you download are in exactly the right form for analysis.  For example, you might want to analyze just Yolo county neighborhoods. Or you might want to discard certain variables from the dataset to reduce clutter. Or you encounter missing data. The process of gathering data in its raw form and molding it into a form that is suitable for its end use is known as *data wrangling*.  

In this guide, we won't have time to go through all of the methods and functions in R that are associated with the data wrangling process. Many methods you will have to learn on your own given the specific tasks you will need to accomplish.  In the rest of this guide, we'll go through some of the basic data wrangling techniques using the functions found in the package **dplyr**, which was automatically installed and loaded when you brought in the **tidyverse** package.  These functions can be used for tibbles and regular data frames.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Renaming variables**
\

You will likely encounter a variable in a dataset with a name that is not descriptive. The more descriptive the names, the more efficient your analysis will be and the less likely you are going to make a mistake. To see the names of variables in your dataset, use the `names()` command.  

```{r}
names(neighborhoods)
```

Use the command `rename()` to - what else? - rename a variable!  Let's rename *NAME* to *County*.  

```{r}
neighborhoods <- rename(neighborhoods, County = "NAME")
```

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Selecting variables**
\

In practice, most of the data files you will download will contain variables you don't need. It is easier to work with a smaller dataset as it reduces clutter and clears up memory space, which is important if you are executing complex tasks on a large number of observations.  Use the command `select()` to keep variables by name.  Visually, we are doing the following (taken from the RStudio [cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf))  


<center>
![](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/GEO 200CN/lab/geo200cn.github.io/subsetcols.png)

</center>


Let's keep *County*, *GEOID*, and *hisp*, *nhwhite*, *nhblk* and *tpopr* from the *neighborhoods* dataset.

```{r}
select(neighborhoods, County, GEOID, hisp, nhwhite, nhblk, tpopr)
```

You can use also use `select()` command to keep variables *except* for the ones you designate.  For example, to keep all variables in *neighborhoods* except *nhasn* and save this back into *neighborhoods*, type in

```{r, results="hide"}
neighborhoods <- select(neighborhoods, -nhasn)
neighborhoods
```

The negative sign tells R to exclude the variable.


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Creating new variables**
\

The `mutate()` function allows you to create new variables within your dataset.  This is important when you need to transform variables in some way - for example, calculating a ratio or adding two variables together.  Visually, you are doing this

<center>
![](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/GEO 200CN/lab/geo200cn.github.io/mutate.png)

</center>

You can use the `mutate()` command to generate as many new variables as you would like.  For example, let's construct three new variables in *neighborhoods* - the percent of residents who are non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic.  Name these variables *pwhite*, *pblack*, and *phisp*, respectively.

```{r, results="hide"}
mutate(neighborhoods, pwhite = nhwhite/tpopr, pblack = nhblk/tpopr, 
       phisp = hisp/tpopr)
```

Note that you can create new variables based on the variables you just created in the same line of code. For example, you can create a categorical variable yielding "Majority" if the tract is majority Hispanic and "Not Majority" otherwise after creating the percent Hispanic variable within the same `mutate()` command.  Let's save these changes back into *neighborhoods*.

```{r, results="hide"}
neighborhoods <- mutate(neighborhoods, pwhite = nhwhite/tpopr,  
              pblack = nhblk/tpopr, phisp = hisp/tpopr,
              mhisp = ifelse(phisp > 0.5, "Majority","Not Majority"))
neighborhoods
```

We used the function `ifelse()` to create *mhisp* - the function tells R that if the condition `phisp > 0.5` is met, the tract's value for the variable *mhisp* will be "Majority", otherwise it will be "Not Majority".


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Filtering**
\

Filtering means selecting rows/observations based on their values.  To filter in R, use the command `filter()`.  Visually, filtering rows looks like.

<center>
![](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/GEO 200CN/lab/geo200cn.github.io/subsetrows.png)

</center>

The first argument in the parentheses of this command is the name of the data frame. The second and any subsequent arguments (separated by commas) are the expressions that filter the data frame. For example, we can select Sacramento county

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(neighborhoods, County == "Sacramento")
```

The double equal operator `==` means equal to.  We can also explicitly exclude cases and keep everything else by using the not equal operator `!=`.  The following code *excludes* Sacramento county.

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(neighborhoods, County != "Sacramento")
```


What about filtering if a neighborhood has a value greater than a specified value?  For example, neighborhoods with a percent white greater than 0.5 (50%). 

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(neighborhoods, pwhite > 0.5)
```

What about less than 0.5 (50%)?

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(neighborhoods, pwhite < 0.5)
```

Both lines of code do not include neighborhoods that have a percent white equal to 0.5.  We include it by using the less than or equal operator `<=` or greater than or equal operator `>=`.

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(neighborhoods, pwhite <= 0.5)
```

In addition to comparison operators, filtering may also utilize logical operators that make multiple selections.  There are three basic logical operators: `&` (and), `|` is (or), and `!` is (not).  We can keep neighborhoods with *phisp* greater than 0.5 **and** *tpopr* greater than 5000 using `&`.

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(neighborhoods, phisp > 0.5 & tpopr > 5000)
```

Use `|` to keep neighborhoods in Sacramento **or** Yolo

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(neighborhoods, County == "Sacramento" | County == "Yolo")
```

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Joining tables**
\

Often you will have two datasets containing the same observations but with different variables.  Your goal is to combine the datasets into a single one. 

Let's join a dataset containing some health and air pollution data from California's [CalEnviroScreen](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-30) program. Read it in from GitHub using our new friend `read_csv()`.

```{r warning=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
ces <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geo200cn/data/master/ces.csv")
names(ces)
```

The dataset contains the poverty rate, air pollution levels ([PM2.5](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics)), and whether the neighborhood is environmentally disadvantaged according to the CES.  To join the objects *ces* and *neighborhoods*, we need a unique ID that connects the observations across the two files. This unique is named *GEOID* in both files. The IDs should be the same data class, which is the case.

```{r}
class(ces$GEOID)
class(neighborhoods$GEOID)
```


To merge the datasets together, use the function `left_join()`, which matches pairs of observations whenever their keys or IDs are equal. We match on the variable *GEOID* and save the merged data set into a new object called *neighces*. 
```{r}
neighces <- left_join(neighborhoods, ces, by = "GEOID")
```

The argument *by* tells R which variable(s) to match rows on, in this case *GEOID*. You can match on multiple variables and you can also match on a single variable with different variable names (see the `left_join()` help documentation for how to do this). 

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Other functions**
\

If you have a dataset with a lot of variables, you might want to put important variables at or close to the front.  To relocate variables in your dataset, use the function `relocate()`. Currently, this is the order of variables in *neighborhoods*

```{r}
names(neighborhoods)
```

Use `relocate()` to move up *tpopr* right after *GEOID* and *County*

```{r}
neighborhoods <- relocate(neighborhoods, GEOID, County, tpopr)
names(neighborhoods)
```

What if you want to arrange rows? Use the `arrange()` function.  Use the function `head()` to see what are the observations at the top of your file

```{r}
head(neighborhoods)
```

What if we wanted to sort the rows by population size in descending order?

```{r}
neighborhoods <- arrange(neighborhoods, tpopr)
head(neighborhoods)
```

To sort in descending order, add a `-` sign in front of the variable

```{r}
neighborhoods <- arrange(neighborhoods, -tpopr)
head(neighborhoods)
```


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Function conflicts**
\

You'll learn to understand that R is beautiful.  But, it isn't perfect. One of its annoyances is that because R is open source, R users who contribute packages sometimes create functions with the same names. To demonstrate this, let's load in the package **MASS**

```{r}
library(MASS)
```

You see the warning? Keep it in mind. 

Let's use the function `select()` again to keep the variables *GEOID* and *PM2.5* from *neighces*

```{r error = TRUE}
select(neighces, GEOID, PM2.5)
```

What in the world just happened? By loading **MASS**, we have overwritten **tidyverse**’s `select()` function (hence the warning when you loaded **MASS**). R will choose the function from the package that was most recently loaded. The normal workaround is to be explicit about which `select()` function you want by using `dplyr::select()` as in

```{r}
dplyr::select(neighces, GEOID, PM2.5)
```

To unload a package (i.e. "unlibrary" it) use the `detach()` function as follows.

```{r}
detach("package:MASS")
```

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Pipes**
\

One of the important innovations from the **tidyverse** is the pipe operator `%>%`. [Pipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofsljUAUdlc) are the workhorse of tidy analyses. Piping allows you to chain together many functions, eliminating the need to define multiple intermediate objects to use as the input to subsequent functions. [Pipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B5VBH0y2Ig) are also the primary reason that **tidyverse** code is fundamentally easier to read than base R code.

It may seem complicated at first, but what the pipe does is actually quite simple. That is, it allows users to write linear code. To illustrate the use of the pipe, consider the following base R code that takes the mean of the log of three numbers

```{r}
mean(log(c(1, 3, 9)))
```

Notice how the numbers *c(1, 3, 9)* are nested inside `log()`, which is then nested inside `mean()`. If you’re reading the code from left-to-right, it means the functions are performed in reverse order from how they are written. If we broke the code down into its three functions, we would actually expect the order of operations to proceed as follows

1. Concatenate numbers into vector `c(...)`
2. Log the numeric vector `log(...)`
3. Estimate the mean of the logged numeric vector `mean(...)`

Now consider how you would do this using pipes.

```{r}
c(1, 3, 9) %>% 
  log() %>% 
  mean()
```

In contrast to the nested base code, the tidy code is linear; in other words, the code appears in the same order (moving from left to right) as the operations are performed.  Let's bring back our original *neighborhoods* dataset 

```{r warning=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
neighborhoods <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geo200cn/data/master/week2data.csv")
```

and use pipes to 

1. rename the variable *NAME* to *County* 
2. keep all variables except *nhasn*
3. create the percent race/ethnicity and majority Hispanic variables 
4. join the *ces* file

```{r results = "hide"}
neighces <- neighborhoods %>%
  rename(County = NAME) %>%
  select(GEOID, County, hisp, nhblk, nhwhite, tpopr) %>%
  mutate(pwhite = nhwhite/tpopr, phisp = hisp/tpopr,
         pblk = nhblk/tpopr, 
         mhisp = ifelse(phisp > 0.5, "Majority","Not Majority")) %>%
  left_join(ces, by = "GEOID")
```

In the code above, the tibble *neighborhoods* is piped into the command `rename()`.  This command changes *NAME* to *County*.  The resulting object gets piped into the command `select()`. And so on.

Piping makes code clearer, and simultaneously gets rid of the need to define any intermediate objects that you would have needed to keep track of while reading the code.
