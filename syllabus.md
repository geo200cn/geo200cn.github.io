## **Course Objectives**

After successfully completing this course, you should:

1.	Have an understanding of what quantitative methods are used to study geographic phenomena
2.	Have an understanding of how and which quantitative methods are used in tackling geographical problems
3.	Have an understanding of the statistical underpinnings of each method
4.	Be capable of comprehending academic literature that uses quantitative methods
5.	Be able to employ quantitative methods using the software program R
6.	Feel empowered working with data
7.	Be prepared to take advanced courses in multivariate and spatial statistics


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Course Format**

The course is organized into the following phases.  

1.	Statistical Foundation: We will cover core statistical concepts that will form the foundation to many of the methods covered in the class.  Topics covered include basic probability, sampling, and statistical inference.

2.	Descriptive: We will cover methods of using data to describe geographic phenomena.  We are not trying to make any causal claims, but are simply trying to explore the data and reveal associations.  Topics covered include exploratory data analysis, mapping, clustering, and point pattern analysis.
  
3.	Inferential:  We will cover approaches of using data to infer the causes and consequences of geographic phenomena and processes.   Here, we move away from associations and move towards causality.  We will cover the building blocks of inferential statistics. We will then extensively cover regression, the workhorse of statistical inference in the sciences.

4.	Predictive: We will cover approaches of using data to predict geographic phenomena.  We don’t care about description or about making causal claims, but about predictive quality and best fit. We will cover topics in Geostatistics and methods in statistical learning.


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Lecture**

The Tuesday/Thursday 9:00-10:30 am classes will be a combination of lecture and discussion covering the substantive topics from the week’s readings.  There are readings for each lecture and they generally cover the mathematical underpinnings of the topics for that lecture 

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Lab**

The Tuesday/Thursday 11:00-12:50 pm labs will provide students the opportunity to apply the methods from the week’s readings on real data using the statistical software program R.  Attendance is not mandatory.  However, labs will provide an opportunity to gain assistance with lab guides and assignments from the TA and your classmates.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Required Readings**

The primary reading material is composed of a combination of the following three textbooks

1.	(BBR) Burt, J. E., G. M. Barber, and D.L. Rigby. 2009. Elementary statistics for geographers, 3rd Edition, Guilford Press.

2.	(OSU) O’Sullivan, D. and D. Unwin. 2010. Geographic Information Analysis, 2nd Edition, Wiley.

3.	(ISLR) James, G., D. Witten, T. Hastie and R. Tibshirani. 2013.  An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R. Springer. 

We will also be reading book chapters and journal articles for some topics, which will be available on Canvas.  There are also journal article readings for each substantive topic that shows a real-world application of the method.  These readings are listed in the document reading_response.pdf uploaded onto Canvas.   You will need to complete reading responses for two of these readings.  


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Course Software**

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is the only statistical language used in this course, as it has become an increasingly popular program for data analysis in the social sciences.  R is freeware and you can download it on your personal laptop and desktop computers.  We will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as a user friendly interface for R.  Lab computers will also have R and RStudio.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Course Requirements** 

1. Assignments (70%)

Assignments will be released on Canvas typically before Tuesday’s lecture.  They will be typically due on Canvas one week later on the following Tuesday before lecture.  For each assignment, you will need to submit an R Markdown Rmd and a knitted pdf or html file on Canvas.  Complete assignment guidelines can be found [here](https://geo200cn.github.io/hw_guidelines.html).  If you get stuck you can seek help from the TA, who will be available in the scheduled lab sessions and during office hours.  We also encourage you to work with other students, **but you must submit your own assignment**.  

Late submissions will be deducted 10% per 24 hours until 72 hours after the submission due time.  After 72 hours your submission will not be graded.  

2. Reading responses (10%)

There is a set of empirical readings that complement the course topics. You are required to complete two reading responses by the end of the quarter.  The responses will demonstrate your ability to analyze the research design and methods of published works, and demonstrate your own comprehension of basic concepts and ideas in quantitative spatial analysis.  You are encouraged to complete responses as we go, but you can submit both at the same time at any point in the quarter, including the last day of class.  If you found a peer-reviewed journal article that covers one of the course methods that you would like to summarize but is not listed, please let me know.  

3. Midterm exam (20%)

There will be one take home midterm exam.  The exam will test conceptual material covered in the lectures and readings preceding the midterm date.  The exam is “open-book” in the sense that you can use the slides, your notes, books, and internet resources to answer the questions. However, the exam must be completed by yourself.
